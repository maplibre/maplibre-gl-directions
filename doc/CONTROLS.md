The {@link LoadingControl} adds a spinning wheel that appears whenever there's an ongoing routing requests and automatically disappears as soon as the request is finished.

The loading indicator's appearance is configurable via the {@link LoadingControlConfiguration} object that is (optionally) passed as the second argument to the @{link LoadingControl} constructor.
