This is the Demo project's source files. It's used for 2 purposes:

1. As a test-stand for manual testing when developing the plugin
2. As a demo-website for the demonstration purposes

Serve it locally with `npm run dev:demo`. Check whether it builds correctly with `npm run build:demo`.

The resulting static-website is put inside the `/docs` folder and is combined with the API documentation static-website automatically when the `main` branch is pushed.
