The source code of the plugin lives here. The API documentation for it is parsed from the comments left inside these source files. The `directions` folder holds the code which serves the plugin's main purpose: routing and user-interaction. The `controls` folder at the time being contains the source code of the only plugin's control - the loading indicator control.

The `main.ts` file is the main entry point of the library.
